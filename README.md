In this project, we focus on implementing a function 'build_deep_nn' that trains and evaluates a deep learning classifier on the MNIST dataset.

The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

Then, we use 'keras_tuner' to define the optimal parameters of the network model.
